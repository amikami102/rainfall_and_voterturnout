This file documents the progress made in the analysis of our data. As files get moved, reorganized, rewritten, and archived, the older markdown documents can no longer be compiled. 

## replicating Duhaime and Moulton (2017)

We replicate Duhaime and Moulton's paper. 

## 2018-07-18

We use Duhaime and Moulton's data to run our own models.

## 2018-09-30 

We begin using the CCES dataset, aiming for hierarchical model that uses predictors observed at individual and county levels. The data for rainfall is taken from Cooperman (2017)'s dataset.

## 2019-03-22

We merge CCES datasets to the rainfall data that we retrieved from GHCND-Daily instead of using Cooperman's dataset. At this point, the directory has been overhauled and reorganized, and scripts made prior to 2019 have been modified or archived.
